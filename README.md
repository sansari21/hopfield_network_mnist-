# Hopfield Network for MNIST Classification

## Objective
To classify MNIST digits using a  Hopfield Network  and compare its performance with classical and deep learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Methodology
- **Data Preparation**: Loaded and normalized the MNIST dataset. Processed and stored average patterns for each digit class (0-9).
- **Network Implementation**: Implemented a continuous updater rule using a softmax function to simulate network dynamics and enhance the performance of the Continuous Hopfield Network over traditional Hopfield Networks.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 63.10% and a weighted F1 score of 0.6242.
